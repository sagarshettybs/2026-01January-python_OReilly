    "# What is \"mutable\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have an integer 5, then its value is 5. Can you change it to be the integer 4? Or maybe the integer 10?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, we understand that the value of 5 is *immutable*, it cannot change. If I assign a price to a product in the store, and I say that the price is 5, that's the same 5 as we use elsewhere in our lives. It cannot suddenly become 4 or 10. But we could assign a new price, and that price would be different from 5. Assigning a new price wouldn't mean that 5 was suddenly worth some other number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, numbers (integers and floats) are immutable, just as they are in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "But also immutable are strings! Once you create a string value, it cannot change. If you say `s = 'abcd'`, then the variable `s` refers to that string, `'abcd'`. You can assign a new string value to `s`, but you cannot change the string that has been assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you think that you're changing a string, you're not! You're creating a new string based on an existing one, and then assigning that new one back to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we haven't seen any *mutable* values, only *immutable* ones. However, that's going to change today, when we talk about lists."

    "- I C, the loop control part has three sections:\n",
    "    - Initialization of the index before the loop starts (`i=0`)\n",
