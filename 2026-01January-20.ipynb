The first part of that pair is similar to the index we've used in a list or tuple *except* that it can be almost anything! They keys, as they're known, can be any immutable type, and we often use integers or strings.  You can think of a dict, in some ways, as a list where you can dictate what the indexes are, rather than just accepting 0, 1, 2, etc.\n",
