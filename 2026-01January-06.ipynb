    "There have long been \"REPLs\" in the programming world, aka read-eval-print loops, that allow you to just experiment with code, and try things out. Jupyter is a modern REPL, in that it works inside of your Web browser. You can code, and try things without having to worry about a full-fledged editor, project, etc.\n",
