    "\n",
    "Back when computers were invented, every computer was built to solve one problem, and only one problem. You had a new problem? You built a new computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "This was very expensive and time-consuming. Pretty quickly, people started to build general-purpose computers. The way that you would give different instructions to the same computer was with programming. At that time, all programs were written in binary code, i.e., 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty soon, people invented programming languages. The idea was: You write in a language that's closer to English/human language. A program then goes over that code, and translates it into 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 10s or 100s of thousands of programming languages in the world. Some are more famous than others:\n",
    "\n",
    "- C -- very close to the binary 1s and 0s. Very fast to execute, but very tricky to write well.\n",
    "- C++ -- This is for people who think that C is too easy, and want to challenge themselves.\n",
    "- Java -- makes object-oriented programming easier than C++\n",
    "- C# -- Microsoft's copy of Java (at least originally)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is now one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It promotes a few things:\n",
    "- Readability, for easier writing, reading, and maintenance\n",
    "- Community -- the language is written by the people who use it as an open-source (community) project\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become super popular in a number of areas:\n",
    "- Data science and machine learning\n",
    "- Data analysis\n",
    "- Devops (server configuration and deployment)\n",
    "- Automated testing\n",
    "- Web applications\n",
    "- Education\n",

You can use any indentation (combination of tabs and spaces) you want, so long as you're consistent, and do it precisely the same way on all lines of a block. But in practice, Python coders let their tools indent for them, using a convention of 4 spaces per indentation level.\n",
