    "Traditionally, we write Python code in files, and then run the contents of that file. That is a lot of time and energy just to get it to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have long been \"REPLs\" in the programming world, aka read-eval-print loops, that allow you to just experiment with code, and try things out. Jupyter is a modern REPL, in that it works inside of your Web browser. You can code, and try things without having to worry about a full-fledged editor, project, etc.\n",

    "- Documentation written in \"Markdown\" (that's what I'm using here)\n",
