    "- `input`\n",
    "- `len`\n",
    "- `type`\n",
    "- `sum`\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we need to write our own functions? No! We can have a perfectly reasonable program without writing any new functions ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOWEVER, that will violate the DRY Rule -- Don't Repeat Yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we have the same code on several lines in a row, we should/can replace those lines with a loop\n",
    "- If we have the same code in several places in our program, we can/should replace those with a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that instead of having the same code in many places, we'll have it in a single place, and just refer to it each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "One big advantage is that we only have to write the code once.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea of abstraction is that we put a name on many small things, and then treat it as one big thing. By doing this, we ignore the lower-level details, and can think at a higher level -- and thus solve higher-level, bigger problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction allows us to solve a problem, package it up, give it a name, and then deal with it as a single entity. Functions do this for collections of actions. \n",
